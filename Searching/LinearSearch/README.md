# Linear Search
	One of the simplest search available, which iterate through each elemets or traverse each element on a list and compare with the provided value to match. Linear Search doesn't need the collection to be sorted in any order.

## Worst Case Scenario
 - It has to loop through entire collection to find the match either because the element is last one or is not present in collection at all.

## Best Case Scenario
 - The element is found at the first index or it is the first element on the collection.
